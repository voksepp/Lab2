Time complexity analysis

Insert bid:
    n is the size of the order book. The bids are sorted in a binary heap so when a new bid is
    inserted the insert method puts it in the end of the binary heap and then calls the bubbleUp
    method. The bubble up function calls the swap method until (worst case scenario) the bid has
    reached the root. A full binary tree has the height h = log_2(l)+1 where l is the
    amount of leaves. The size n = 2*l-1. This makes the time complexity O(log_2((n+2)/2)) =
    O(log_2(n))


One trade: O(log n)

Modifying a bid: O(log n)
    When a bid is modified

Printing the order book: O(XXX)
